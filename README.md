Visual Checking Failures toward Vulnerable Road Users: An on-Road Study

This pipeline is based on an existing data set from an on-road study by Kaya (2019), which offers comprehensive data of 26 drivers who completed 18 different turns around the Bloor-Bathurst area while in an instrumented vehicle. The main dependent variable in this study is whether or not the driver failed to check a pre-identified area of importance where vulnerable road users (VRUs) may be located. This is dubbed as a "visual checking failure". For example, before making a right turn, a right mirror check is required to look for oncoming cyclists. This outcome variable, Failure, is based on the consensus of 3 trained raters who systematically reviewed eye-tracking camera data. The same three raters independently coded motor vehicle, cyclist, and pedestrian traffic density as either 1 (low) , 2 (medium), or 3 (high), while subjectively taking into account the duration of time spent turning. These were then averaged to attain a single traffic density rating for each participantâ€™s turn. This was repeated for all three traffic types: motor vehicle, pedestrian, and cyclist. The dataset also includes demographic, self-report variables.

For a comprehensive list of study variables and descriptions, please see the attached Codebook.

Note for Charlotte:
The first part of the script requires Base R (rather than R studio) due to issues reading in the extra wide dataset in RStudio. After viewing/running Script 1, please open Script 2 in RStudio for the remaining code.
